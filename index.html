  <h1>COVID-19 Trends</h1>
  <div id="scene1-content">
    <p>
        COVID-19 first appeared in China in late 2019 and rapdily spread across the globe. In March 2020, COVID was declared a pandemic by the WHO, as it
        led to millions of deaths and overwhelemed healthcare systems. Lockdowns, school cloosures, and economic shutodnws had lasting social and financial impacts.
        As the world entered crisis mode, vaccination rollouts varied siginficantly across countries, with disparities in total vaccinations, coverage per hundred people, etc.
        These differences highlight both the urgency of pandemic response and the inequality in access to healthcare resources. By anaylzing this dataset, we can better understand
        how vaccine distribution shaped the course of the pandemic, and which countries took quick action.

    <h2>Top 15 Countries by Total Vaccinations </h2>
    <!-- Summary-->
    <p> 
        As of March 2022, these 15 countries lead in total COVID-19 vaccinations administered. This list includes both highly populated countries like India
         and the U.S., as well as nations with strong healthcare infrastructures. While the total numbers highlight the sheer scale of vaccination efforts, they don't
          capture how evenly vaccines were distributed among the population. To get a fuller picture, we'll also look at per-100 vaccination rates and the share of people fully vaccinated.

    <h2> Top 15 Countries by Total Vaccinations per 100 People</h2>
    <p>
        This view adjusts for population size. It shows the countries that have vaccinated the highest proportion of people, not just
        the highest number of people. Countries with a stronger healthcare infrastruture dominate this chart.

    <h2> Trends in daily COVID-19 vaccinations per million</h2>
    <p>
        This line chart shows the vaccination trends over time in the top 15 countries by both total vaccinations and vaccinations per capita.
    Tracking daily vaccinations per million people helps us understand not just how many doses were administered, but how rapidly and consistently
    each country responded to COVID-19. Peaks and dips in the chart can reflect policy changes, supply issues, or public uptake patterns.
