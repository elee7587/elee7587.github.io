  <!-- Summary-->
  <p> 
    As of March 2022, these are the top 15 countries by total COVID-19 vaccinations. An important thing to note
    is that these values include both high-population nations like India and the U.S., and countries with robust healthcare systems.
    While these numbers show the scale and magnitude of vaccinations, they don't reflect the full story. We will dive into other features including
    per-capita, # of people vaccinated, etc.

    This view adjusts for population size. It shows the countries that have vaccinated the highest proportion of people, not just
    the highest number of people. Countries with a stronger healthcare infrastruture dominate this chart.
