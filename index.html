  <h1>COVID-19 Trends</h1>
  <div id="scene1-content">
    <p>
        COVID-19 first appeared in China in late 2019 and rapdily spread across the globe. In March 2020, COVID was declared a pandemic by the WHO, as it
        led to millions of deaths and overwhelmed healthcare systems. Lockdowns, school closures, and economic shutodnws had lasting social and financial impacts.
        As the world entered crisis mode, vaccination rollouts varied siginficantly across countries, with disparities in total vaccinations, coverage per hundred people, etc.
        These differences highlight both the urgency of pandemic response and the inequality in access to healthcare resources. By anaylzing this dataset, we can better understand
        how vaccine distribution shaped the course of the pandemic, and which countries took quick action.

    <h2>Top 15 Countries by Total Vaccinations </h2>
    <!-- Summary-->
    <p> 
        As of March 2022, these 15 countries lead in total COVID-19 vaccinations administered. This list includes both highly populated countries like India
         and the U.S., as well as nations with strong healthcare infrastructures. While the total numbers highlight the sheer scale of vaccination efforts, they don't
          capture how evenly vaccines were distributed among the population. As we dive in, we will see what countries truly responded with intent to get the fuller picture.

    <h2> Top 15 Countries by Total Vaccinations per 100 People</h2>
    <p>
        This bar chart adjusts for population size. It shows the countries that have vaccinated the highest proportion of people, not just
        the highest number of people. Countries with a stronger healthcare infrastruture dominate this chart. Something to note is China is the only country that is in both
        the top 15 countries for total vaccinations and total vaccinations per 100 people. That can be attested to the fact that COVID-19 formed in China,
        but this really shows the lack of effort these large countries made to neutralize the virus. In the next slide, we will dive further into the timely responses looking
        at how these countries responded over the course of over a year.

    <h2> Trends in daily COVID-19 vaccinations per million</h2>
    <p>
        This line chart shows the vaccination trends over time in the top 15 countries by both total vaccinations and vaccinations per 100 people.
    Tracking daily vaccinations per million  helps us understand not just how many doses were administered, but how rapidly and consistently
    each country responded to COVID-19. Peaks and dips in the chart can reflect policy changes, supply issues, or public uptake patterns. Take your time to look through each country
    and see what stands out to you about their response time.

    <h2> Country's COVID-19 Information </h2>
    <p>
        After these views, I hope you gained a better understanding of how countries responded to the pandemic, and the impact that it had globally. 
        It's important to note that the healthcare disparity is real, and it plays a huge factor in why a country responded the way they did to COVID.
        Moving forward, countries can hopefully learn from each other about what it takes to prevent a pandemic from happening, and how to mitigate the consequences.
        Please feel free to go through any country on this list and get a general summary of their COVID vaccination information.
