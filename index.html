  <h1>COVID-19 Trends</h1>
  <p>
    COVID-19 first appeared in China in late 2019 and rapdily spread across the globe. In March 2020, COVID was declared a pandemic by the WHO, as it
      led to millions of deaths and overwhelemed healthcare systems. Lockdowns, school cloosures, and economic shutodnws had lasting social and financial impacts.
      As the world entered crisis mode, vaccination rollouts varied siginficantly across countries, with disparities in total vaccinations, coverage per hundred people, etc.
      These differences highlight both the urgency of pandemic response and the inequality in access to healthcare resources. By anaylzing this dataset, we can better understand
      how vaccine distribution shaped the course of the pandemic, and which countries took quick action.

    <h2>Top 15 Countries by Total Vaccinations </h2>
    <!-- Summary-->
    <p> 
      As of March 2022, these are the top 15 countries by total COVID-19 vaccinations. An important thing to note
      is that these values include both high-population nations like India and the U.S., and countries with robust healthcare systems.
      While these numbers show the scale and magnitude of vaccinations, they don't reflect the full story. We will dive into other features including
      per-capita, # of people vaccinated, etc.

        This view adjusts for population size. It shows the countries that have vaccinated the highest proportion of people, not just
        the highest number of people. Countries with a stronger healthcare infrastruture dominate this chart.
